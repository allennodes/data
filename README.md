# Project: Conduct complete data analytics and predictive modeling to predict crime types by day type and district.



> **Project Brief**:  

Crime in Chicago has been worrisome to the Chicago PD. Reported crimes have been tracked on a daily basis since 2001 and have been provided in the project data file. The Chicago PD would like to drastically reduce the spate of violent crimes reported in the city. 
Being effective involves knowing crime patterns and where they are likely to occur. 
It also involves equipping the Police Department appropriately. 
They have recruited you to conduct full data analytics and predictive modeling to uncover insights from the data that can be used to effectively mobilize and respond to crimes in shorter time cycles. 
They are interested in gleaning any insights that can help them determine:
<p>What type of crimes to prepare for?</p>
<p>Where these crimes are most likely to occur?</p> 
<p>What days of the week and periods to expect these crimes?</p>
